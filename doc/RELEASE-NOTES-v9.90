Easylogging++ v9.90 RELEASE NOTES
---------------------------------

Release type: Major
API changes: Yes
Breaking Change: Yes

This is a major release. We have separated header file in to `easylogging++.h` and `easylogging++.cc`. Source file (`easylogging++.cc`) encompass source to speed up compile time. Thanks to @aparajita.

==========================
=         FIXES          =
==========================

 - Fix to custom datetime format in Unicode mode

==========================
=      NEW FEATURES      =
==========================

 - The `FormatSpecifierValueResolver` function passed to the `CustomFormatSpecifier` constructor
   now receives `const LogMessage&` as an argument. This allows you to access message-specific context
   (such as the verbose level) within your custom formatting function. For an example, see
   samples/STL/custom-format-spec.cpp.
 - Separated header and source file (`easylogging++.h` and `easylogging++.cc`) (issue #445)
 - New `ELPP_DEFAULT_LOGGING_FLAGS` macro for setting initial logging flags
 - C++11 detection is improved, and Clang uses `std::thread` by default if it is available
